# Sink

Automatically watch and sync files with iCloud Drive.

### Getting the code

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Then, you'll probably want to update the `WATCH_PATH` constant in `index.js`, to be the directory or file you want to watch.

Finally your changes will automatically sink into your computers iCloud Drive folder.

### TODO
* Electron UI / GUI for file choosing
* Launch @ Start up
